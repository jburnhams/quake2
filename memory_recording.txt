This task involved implementing post-processing effects (Gamma, Brightness, Underwater Distortion, Bloom) in a WebGL2 rendering engine using TypeScript. Key patterns include: 1. Extending the Renderer interface to expose configuration methods. 2. Registering Cvars in the Client to control these settings dynamically. 3. Implementing multi-pass rendering pipelines (Bloom) using Framebuffers and Texture2D abstractions. 4. Mocking WebGL2 contexts (including createFramebuffer) in Vitest for unit/integration testing of render pipelines.
