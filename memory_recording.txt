This task involved implementing post-processing effects (Gamma, Brightness, Underwater Distortion, Bloom) in a WebGL2 rendering engine. Key learnings: 1. Mocking WebGL2 context in Vitest requires comprehensive mocks including framebuffers for pipeline tests. 2. Implementing Bloom using multi-pass extraction, blur, and composite shaders. 3. Integrating Cvars from client to renderer for dynamic configuration. 4. Handling git merge diff failures when context is tricky.
