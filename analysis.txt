Analysis of CM_RecursiveHullCheck

1.  **Check for early exit:** If the trace has already found a closer collision, exit.
2.  **Check for leaf node:** If the current node is a leaf, trace against the brushes in that leaf and exit.
3.  **Calculate distances to splitting plane:** Calculate the distance from the start and end points of the trace to the splitting plane of the current node.
4.  **Calculate offset:** Calculate the offset of the bounding box from the splitting plane.
5.  **Check which side of the plane the trace is on:**
    *   If the trace is entirely on the front side, recurse into the front child.
    *   If the trace is entirely on the back side, recurse into the back child.
6.  **If the trace crosses the plane:**
    *   Calculate `frac` and `frac2`, the fractions at which the leading and trailing edges of the bounding box cross the plane.
    *   Recurse into the near side of the plane, from the start of the trace to the intersection point.
    *   Recurse into the far side of the plane, from the intersection point to the end of the trace.
